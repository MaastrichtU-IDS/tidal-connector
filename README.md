### Continuous Integration

This repository uses [GitHub Actions](/actions) to:

* Automatically run tests at each push to the `master` branch
* Publish the package to [PyPI](https://pypi.org) when a release is created (N.B.: the version of the package needs to be increased in [setup.py](/blob/master/setup.py#L6) before).

> You will need to provide your login credentials using [secrets in the repository settings](/settings/secrets) to publish to [PyPI](https://pypi.org): `PYPI_USERNAME` and `PYPI_PASSWORD`
